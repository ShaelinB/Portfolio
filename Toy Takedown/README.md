**Development:**

Toy Takedown was developed by a team of four using Unity and C#. This project was built within 48 hours for the granola.gg x IGM Game Jam hosted by RIT. For this project, I was responsible for creating the UI, implementing the tomato animations, and collaborating on coding its attacks.

For the UI, I designed the button and level select assets in Piskel. I also created a UI Manager script that handled scene changes and a pause menu, as well as an Audio Manager script that allowed the player to adjust the gameâ€™s volume.

In addition, I helped develop a script for the tomatoâ€™s attack, although we had to modify it slightly due to time constraints. I also set up the tomatoâ€™s animations by first creating a finite state machine and then making separate animations for each state using the assets created by my teammate.
