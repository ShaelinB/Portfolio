**Development:**

Johnny Rocket was developed in MonoGame using C#. I was responsible for implementing the UI, creating a debug mode, and organizing the game loop logic.

For the UI, I built a button class that instantiated buttons and detected clicks. I also created a debug mode that highlighted all enemies and the player while displaying their stats when pressing F1. In the game loop, I organized code to ensure proper object behavior, rendering order, and overall game logic.

In addition, I collaborated with a teammate to develop a file management system that efficiently loaded levels using multiple text files to define map elements, enemies, and the player.
