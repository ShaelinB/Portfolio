**Development:**

I built the game in Visual Studio Code using JavaScript and Pixi.js, focusing on creating a smooth and engaging player experience. I designed and implemented a shop system where players could upgrade their ship by increasing speed, health, and spread. They could also purchase abilities such as restoring health, eliminating half of the enemies, or gaining coins in exchange for health. Additionally, I created and refined movement and attack mechanics for both player and enemy entities to improve combat engagement.
