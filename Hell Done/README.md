**Development:** Hell Done was created both physically and digitally in Tabletop Simulator by a team of five. My primary responsibilities included designing the Prince of Hell order cards, the generic order cards, and the ingredient cards. When the team decided that the game‚Äôs food theme would be burgers, I brainstormed a variety of burger types. For each Prince of Hell, I also designed a unique burger and a corresponding buff that matched their personality, which players receive when serving that Prince. As a team, we collaboratively developed the game rules and iteratively refined the balance and mechanics through multiple playtests. We maintained a shared design document to track ideas, rules, game assets, and playtest results, ensuring everyone stayed aligned. Through strong communication and teamwork, we were able to create a game that is both fun to play and polished.
