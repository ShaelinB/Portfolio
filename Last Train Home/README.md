**Development:** 

During this project, I was the primary programmer for the game’s audio input system, UI/UX, and scene management. I developed the voice-based gameplay by capturing and analyzing microphone input, and I created the menus, sliders, and the logic that controls scene transitions and overall game progression. A significant part of my work involved learning how to implement voice-driven mechanics, since this was something I was unfamiliar with at the time. Early in development, the other programmer and I explored using an Arduino for audio input, but after researching the idea further, we realized we didn’t have the necessary components to make it possible.

The project was created for the RIT Roll Your Fate Game Jam, where dice rolls determined the theme, genre, input, and art style. We ended up with last train home, horror, voice-only input, and hand-drawn art. After a previous game jam experience taught me the importance of scope and prioritizing quality over quantity, I applied those lessons to this project. As a result, our team designed a game that fit comfortably within the 48-hour window, giving us extra time to polish both the visuals and the gameplay systems.
