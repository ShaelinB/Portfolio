**Development:** 

EcoSnap was developed in Unity using C#. I was primarily responsible for the journal, UI, audio, animal behavior, animal information, and UI art assets. To accomplish this, I programmed multiple scripts handling player input and core gameplay systems.

The journal script tracked which animals the player discovered and unlocked corresponding information, while also allowing page navigation. The UI and audio scripts managed on-screen buttons and sliders for scene/panel transitions and volume control. I collaborated with a teammate on animal behaviors. We initially scripted them manually before switching to NavMesh for more efficient movement.

In addition, I researched accurate animal information and created the art assets for buttons and sliders. Through these efforts, our team successfully conveyed the 2025 Games for Change Student Challenge theme, ‚ÄúNurture Yourself with Nature,‚Äù while delivering a polished and engaging experience.
