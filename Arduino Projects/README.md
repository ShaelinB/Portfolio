**Development:** 

During these projects, I used Arduino to design and implement interactive systems that solved real-world problems and supported game-based experiences.

One project was an automatic watering system that used a soil moisture sensor and water pump. The system continuously monitored moisture levels and activated the pump when a configurable threshold was reached, demonstrating sensor input handling and automated control logic.

Another project explored alternative input methods through a custom controller built with an accelerometer. This controller was used in Pancake Panic, a game where players physically flip a frying pan within a timed window to cook pancakes correctly. The project focused on translating real-world motion data into meaningful gameplay mechanics and feedback.

I also created a digital Etch A Sketch using potentiometers and Processing. Due to the potentiometers’ limited range of motion, the system mapped input to absolute position rather than directional movement, requiring careful input scaling and calibration.

The final project was a collaborative effort in which we developed a Heist Simulator game using an ultrasonic sensor to detect player proximity. The sensor determined whether the player was “caught” while stealing the treasure, integrating physical distance sensing directly into game logic.
