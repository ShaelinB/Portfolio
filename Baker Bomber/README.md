**Description:** This isnâ€™t your average Bomber, meet the Baker Bomber! When not preparing for its next battle, itâ€™s in the kitchen perfecting its signature explosive desserts. Each pie is baked to perfection, topped with a cherry fuse, and ready to burst on impact. Deadly in the arena, delicious at the table.

**Development:**

For the Supercell Make, Clash of Clans Temporary Troop Challenge, I reimagined the preexisting Bomber character as a baker. Using Krita, I created concept art to illustrate my design vision for the Baker Bomber. The character features a chef hat, gloves, a Clash of Clans themed apron, and wields signature explosive pies topped with cherry fuses. This design demonstrates how the original character could be transformed while maintaining a playful and functional identity.
